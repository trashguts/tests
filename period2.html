<h1>period two: study hall / lab</h1>
<blockquote><h2>dr. gullo / mr. minett / mrs. quintero / mrs. viale / mrs. cheque</h2></blockquote>
<hr>

<p>i bring my laptop to school every day for this period. i don't even usually have homework to do, i just play games on steam or watch speedpaints on youtube in the back of the room. or take a nap. whatever floats my boat that day. it's usually around this time i realize i forgot my sick bottle of H<sub>2</sub>O at home and am sad and thirsty.
