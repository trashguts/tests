<h1>period one: english</h1>
<blockquote><h2>mr. minett</h2></blockquote>
<hr>

<p>this class is pretty alright. i don't really have any friends here, but there are talkative people i like listening to. and the teacher's pretty cool. i generally don't enjoy writing or reading, though, so in terms of actually doing the assignments it's definitely my least favorite class. it's also first period, so i tend to not be completely awake yet. i doodle goats on the quizzes and barely talk during class discussions. <q>you are one of the weirdest students i've taught,</q> said mr. minett one time.
