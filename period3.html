<h1>period three: apegs</h1>

<p>this class isn't that hard, but there's a lot of homework that i don't like doing. there's some homework i do enjoy, but most of it isn't fun at all. i enjoy learning about this kinda thing, though, so i generally do pretty good on tests and it all works out. i like a lot of the people in this class, but am pretty introverted so i don't actually talk to them ever. which means i usually end up working by myself on group projects, which is no fun.
